As you can see, in this app you can type a name of your task and add it and you see your task below. You also can search for the task you need. At the right of each task, a minus icon is used to delete that task. A clear task button will help you to clear all task you have once. 

You can run this app by follow these step:
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` to the repo
3. Give the executable script permission to run by run command `chmod +x run.sh`
4. Run command `./run.sh`
